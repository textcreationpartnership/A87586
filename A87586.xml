            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> and the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, when I conſider theſe particulars following,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the definition of a true Church doth accord with you, which is this. A true viſible Church on earth, is a company of people called by God from Idols, to the true Religion, and profeſſing ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that call, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13.</p>

            <p n="3">3. When I conſider that Chriſt is your Head,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.22.</note> and not Antichriſt, though in circumſtantials you doe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize too much with Rome.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When I conſider that you have all the Eſſentials of a true Church, though not all the Circumſtantials;<note place="margin">Eccleſia parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipans ipſam eſſentiam quae ipſi in ſua ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie debetur, eſt vera Eccleſia.</note> We have the Word and Sacraments, like gold Oare mixed with ſome duſt, but yet it is called Gold, <hi>Job</hi> 28.6. <hi>Iob</hi> was a true man, though he was full of biles, and his friends knew him not, <hi>Iob</hi> 2.7.

            <p n="5">5. When I conſider that Chriſt hath not given you a Bill of Divorcement as yet, for he hath ſtill communion with us in his Ordinances, and is about to refine you, &amp; to enter into a neerer union with you: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. he is taking away the names of <hi>Baalim</hi> out of your mouth, and pulling downe the reliques of ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When I conſider your oppoſition in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to the falſe Church, I meane to Rome, that Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When I conſider of Gods extraordinary love to England, in affording us his preſence ſo long, even unto admiration, and in defending his people here as much as in any Church in the whole Chriſtian world; <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.13, 14, 15. <hi>Iacob</hi> would not have kept company ſo much with <hi>Rachel,</hi> if ſhe had not been his beloved wife.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When I conſider your fruitfulneſſe, I cannot but take you to be the Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.16.

               </note> as to deny the womb that bare them, and to deſpiſe the paps that gave them ſuck.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this (deare Mother) I cannot but mourn when I behold your preſent lamentable face in a new, yet true glaſſe, made by ſuch as have not onely skil in feeling your pulſe, but alſo in viewing your phyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie. Wherein though you ſeem to appeare to me, in the ſhape of a true Church, and living Spouſe of Chriſt Jeſus, yet I cannot deny, but that you are a corrupt and ſick one: (the Lord help you) Now in the griefe of my ſoule, give leave to a legitimate child of your owne womb, to crave on his knee one curteſie at your hands, it is but this, to accept and make uſe of a little ſpirituall phyſick prepared for your neceſſity, &amp; preſented to your ſin-ſick, yet curable-ſelfe, in this Galley pot, containing within it, <hi>Parliament phyſick for a ſin-ſick Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leſt you ſhould deny me the common curteſie of indulgent mothers, who love to heare their little ones prattle, and to reade their ſcribling notes, though as full of blots and blurs, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſheep of ring-ſtrakes &amp; ſpots, give me leave to Apologize a little for my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe as the Ordinance of Parliament is new, ſeaſonable, and neceſſary; ſo the Explanation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it muſt needs be ſomething anſwerable to the nature of it, though far ſhort of a correſpondent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe your own Act in that Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body, doth put me upon this Kingdom-healing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I cannot ſo fully and publikely performe, by preaching only, as by writing alſo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe its a thouſand pities that ſuch an Ordinance as this is, ſhould be buryed in the grave of
<pb facs="tcp:123929:4"/>Oblivion, which may be alſo profitable for ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe as I have appeared on the Stage, a friend to the Parliament of England, according to my power; ſo I deſire to goe off no changeling, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, not only a teſtimony of my conſtant reſolution to live and die with ſuch a pious, loyall, charitable, wiſe, and truly Honourable Parliament: but alſo rendring a reaſon of my faith, and Anti-cavalier actions.</p>
            <p>Now what remaineth (deare Mother) but prayers for an all-curing benediction on this Catholicall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of Repentance, hereafter following: Except it may be thought neceſſary to uſe one motive to perſwade your appetite to long after this metaphyſicall potion, &amp; that in regard of its tranſcendent excellencie.</p>
            <p>Many men have received groſſe receipts upon either a vain, or weak hope of a ſhort and imperfect health. And of theſe I will report a few, which the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant they are to be uttered, the more fit they are, 1. To ſhame our negligence in taking, 2.

                     <p>My Author ſaith, that from the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, the Parliament of England had ſuch a lawfull and firme power conferred upon it, that whatſoever was to be conſulted on, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the well-governing and preſervation of the Kingdome, that was to be referred to that Councell. Moreover he ſaith, that if any thing were either decreed or done by the command of King or people, all that was accounted as nothing, of no force, except it were approved on by the authority of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Furthermore he ſaith, That if any thing were to be taken from, or added to the ancient Statutes, that ought to be done by the ſentence of the Councell. Not to be tedious, he affirmeth, That nothing could be eſtabliſhed, but what the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of both Houſes (then ſitting) did like of. Something elſe he ſaith, which I leave to thy owne private examination, and ſerious meditation. From whence collect theſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Poſitions, making good the fore-named Aphoriſme, and preſent practice.</p>

And further, <hi>that without Parliament, your Pope himſelfe was never received, no not in the late time of Queene</hi> Mary.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and even then, his Holineſſe was clogged with <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> conditions, that, Whatſoever had been determined in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and was not repealed, were it never ſo contrary to his Will and Canons, ſhould remaine ſtill inviolable, and ſtand in force: otherwiſe his Holineſſe had gone home again. Such, Maſter <hi>Harding,</hi> is the <hi>Authority of Parliament.</hi> Verily if Parliaments of Realmes be no Parliaments, then will your Pope be no Pope, therefore as you now call the truth of God, which we now profeſſe, a <hi>Parliament Religion,</hi> and a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Goſpell,</hi> even ſo with like ſobriety and gravity of ſpeech, ye might have ſaid, Our Fathers in old time had a <hi>Parliament Chriſt:</hi> And your late fathers and brethren had of late in the time of <hi>Queene Mary,</hi> a <hi>Parliament faith,</hi> a <hi>Parliament Maſſe,</hi> and a <hi>Parliament Pope.</hi>

                  <p>All that hath been or can be ſaid to any purpoſe, in way of oppoſition by the moſt impatient patient, may be reduced into theſe five objections. As 1. That all that is done is againſt the Law of God. 2. Againſt the Law of Nature. 3. Againſt the Law of Nations. 4. Againſt the prerogatives of Chriſtian Princes. 5 Laſtly, againſt the practice of the primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe and more objections, are in part, (though not ſo ſully as might be) anſwered in the Explication and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this preſent Aphoriſme, and in the latter end of this book, in the firſt motive to repentance.</p>

Yet withall, I humbly crave (moſt ſacred Sanhedrin) a licence from your higheſt Court of juſtice, to put your colledge of State Phyſicians, for ever in minde but of one old ſaying, not altogether unneceſſary, or unbeſuiting your moſt ſublime contemplations for the publick-weale of this ſin-ſicke Nation, which is, and it is but this, <hi>Phyſitian heale thy ſelf,</hi> take your own phyſicke of repentance,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.7.

                  <p>And though we ſhould feele the heavy ſtrokes of God yet ſeven times more, it is our duty to accept the puniſhment of our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſay, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and juſt are thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe the Lord who is juſt, is alſo mercifull, and in his infinite mercy hath left the excellent and ſucceſſefull remedy of Repentance to Nations brought neere to the gates of deſtruction and deſpaire, O let not England be negligent in the application of it.</p>
                  <p>Humble addreſſes of a penitent people to a mercifull God, have prevailed with him. They prevailed for <hi>Niniveh,</hi> when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſeemed to be gone out againſt her, and may alſo prevaile for <hi>England.</hi> Thus far the Preparative.</p>
                  <p>In which Preparative are ſeverall Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Ingredient, is Neceſſity, and that in a twofold regard.<note place="margin">Neceſſitie.</note>1. Becauſe <hi>Englands</hi> ſickneſſe is a mortall or deadly diſeaſe, which is Impenitencie, argued by theſe words, <hi>That flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have been ruined by impenitent going on in a courſe of ſinning.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>From whence naturally ariſeth this <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Impenitencie is a Nation-deſtroying ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <div type="aphorism">
                     <head>
                        <hi>APHORISME 2.</hi> Impenitencie is a Nation-deſtroying ſicknes. Iſa. <hi>6.10, 11.</hi> Ier. <hi>29 2</hi> Kings <hi>17.</hi> from the <hi>7.</hi> to the <hi>19.</hi> ver. Ier. <hi>8.6.</hi> Rev. <hi>2.5.</hi>

                     <p>For the better underſtanding of this <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> conſider three things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, conſider what impenitencie is.</p>
                     <p>It is a going on in a courſe of ſinning without repentance. This deſcription is in the beginning of the Ordinance. Wherein conſiſider theſe parts. 1. It is a ſinne. 2. It is a courſe or trade. 3. It is a going on ſtill without repentance; for as Chriſt did deſtroy the works of the devill, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. ſo doth Repentance deſtroy the worke of Impenitencie, it is quite contrary to it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, conſider the grounds of this <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> in generall, and theſe are in number ſixe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a great ſinne, it is a ſinning-ſin, as one calleth it.<note place="margin">Rebell is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </note> It is called <hi>Rebellion, Ier.</hi> 8.5. it is a high aggravation of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is a Diabolicall ſinne; the Devils neither can, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will repent, their impenitentiall hearts are ſo hardned.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is a wrath-treaſuring ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. by it they <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is a Nation-unfencing ſin. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2, 5. It cauſeth God to pull up his hedge about his Vineyard and Church, and ſo to fall to ruine, and all kind of miſchiefe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe it is a Phyſick-rejecting ſin. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. Ye would not come under my wings to be healed and refreſhed. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. The contempt of Phyſick doth more diſpleaſe the Phyſitian, then the loathſomneſſe of it doth trouble him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is a ſin-finiſhing ſin. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.15. Then ſin is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when a man reſolveth to live and lye in it, though it coſt him his life. Now is thy ſore without remedy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. There is no promiſe in the Word of God to an impenitent ſinner, that will not turne and live. It is not ſo much falling into the water
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123929:16"/>that drowneth, but the lying in it: So it is not ſo much the falling into ſinne, as the lying and continuing in ſinne, that damneth the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, conſider the Demonſtration of this Poſition in-parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as it concerneth this Nation wherein we live. To this end, let us a little look over the foure great changes of England in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and we ſhall finde that the ſinnes of our fore-fathers, which were not repented of, were the meritorious cauſe of their long-ſince paſt miſeries. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39.</p>

And if it had chanced them to have been over come at any time by Engliſhmen, it availed nothing, becauſe other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies ſtill with greater power in other places were ready on a ſodain and unawares to approach upon them, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>From whence it appeareth, that a going on in a courſe of ſinning without repentance, is a Nation-deſtroying ſickneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth great change was at the comming in of the Normans into England, as appeareth in the Church hiſtories, and the ſin of the land was the cauſe of the miſery of it, as appeareth by many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, I will only quote a few for my purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, that the cruell fact of Earle <hi>Godwine,</hi>

For ſo juſt and right it was, that as the Normans coming with a naturall Engliſh Prince were murthered of Engliſh men: ſo afterward the Engliſh

                     <p>They that write the hiſtory of the vertuous and bleſſed King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> make mention of a dreame or revelation that ſhould be ſhewed to him in time of ſickneſſe, which was to this effect. How that becauſe the Peeres and Biſhops of the Realme were not the ſervants of God, but of the devil, therefore God would give this Realme unto the hand of others. And the King deſired ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance to be given him, that he might declare the ſame to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereby they might repent; but anſwer was made, that they would not repent, and that it ſhould be given to another people.

Our Magiſtrates did abuſe to their wordly gaine, both Gods goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Miniſters of the ſame; the people in many places, were way-ward and unkind: thus of every ſide, and of every ſort, we have provoked Gods anger and wrath to fall upon us, but bleſſed be he that hath not ſuffered his to continue in thoſe wayes, which ſo wholly have diſpleaſed his ſacred Majeſty, but hath awakened them by the fatherly correction of his own Sonnes croſſe, unto his glory, and our endleſſe ſalvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                     <p>Our bleſſed Saviour and great Phyſitian of our ſoules, when hee firſt began to practice ſpirituall phyſick according to his calling, did begin with the bitter potion of Repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.17. as moſt neceſſary to cure all ſpirituall maladies. But he finding that very few ſinners came to his chamber, he doth not onely invite them to come to him, but he doth labour to qualifie and prepare them for his phyſick,<note place="margin">Senſus noſtrae miſeriae, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus eſt gradus, quo venitur ad Chriſtum. <hi>Pareus.</hi>
                        </note> and their owne cure. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. Now this preparation, it is Humility. As if he had ſaid, You will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ruled by me for your owne health and reſt, except you be meek, humble, and lowly in heart. Therefore he ſaith, that he <hi>came
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123929:20"/>to call ſinners to repentance,</hi> and not the <hi>righteous, Mat.</hi> 9.13. That is, ſuch as are humble ſinners, and not proud ſinners,<note place="margin">Plus quam vulgaris ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fuit hic morbus. <hi>Cal. Marl.</hi>

This proud conceit of our owne ability and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath been the common ſickneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinfull, yet ſelfe-conceited poſterity, and is a moſt deadly diſtemper in theſe dayes.</p>
                     <p>There is a twofold Humility: Firſt, there is a Humility towards God; Secondly, towards Man. In this place, we are primarily to labour for Humility towards God, with whom in Repentance we have eſpecially to doe, as appeareth by the Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the ſcope whereof I intend to confine my wandring thoughts.</p>

                     <p>Deſpaire taketh off the Charet wheeles, and maketh a ſinner drive heavily through the red-ſea of ſin-guiltineſſe, ſo that the ſoul ſaith, Let us flee from the face of God, for he fighteth for our ſins, againſt our ſinfull ſelves.</p>

                     <p>Of theſe in order.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, this Parliament repentance, its a bitter grief of heart. This appeareth by the firſt words in the definition, wherein two things are remarkable. 1. The truth of it, in that it is called <hi>grief of heart.</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:123929:31"/>2. The meaſure of it, in that it is called <hi>a bitter griefe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, it muſt be a reall and hearty ſorrow.<note place="margin">Poenitentia in corde ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </note> By the renting of the heart, we are to underſtand the ſincerity of this ſorrow. God requireth repentance in ſecret, for this is the beſt repentance, moſt free from hypocriſie. Then God is moſt willing to forgive, when we doe ſeriouſly and indeed grieve for our ſins: heart and hands muſt goe together. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>What God hath joyned, let no man put aſunder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, it muſt not onely be a hearty and true griefe, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a bitter griefe, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.12. it muſt be with faſting, weeping,<note place="margin">Lucerate cor. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                        </note> and mourning, and our hearts muſt be rent, or cut in pieces, and not onely raſed, or pricked.<note place="margin">Mediocris poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentia non ſufficit, quum vos tot ſceleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſitis mihi obſtricti. <hi>Cal.</hi>
                        </note> Therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith very well to this purpoſe, God doth not onely require the truth of godly ſorrow, but the degree of it, for a little is not enough, ſeeing we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many great ſins againſt God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Saint <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Be afflicted, and mourne, and weepe, let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heavineſſe.</hi> If ever a mourning weed were in ſeaſon, ſure its now in faſhion, though too few weare it. It is with moſt men, as with thoſe in <hi>Amos</hi> 6.6. or like thoſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.17.<note place="margin">Qui nullis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentis ad veram poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam permove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. <hi>Aretius.</hi>
                        </note> who did not ſuit themſelves with the times. They were called to Repentance, but no arguments would prevaile with that pertinacious people. They would not mourne to thoſe that mourned to them, but like the unconverted Romans, who did not onely ſinne againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but alſo had pleaſure in thoſe that did ſinne together with themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Parliament repentance is a generall griefe, and that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, 1. In regard of ſinne, it muſt be for all ſinne. 2. In regard of puniſhment, it muſt be for all the miſery of this polluted and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Nation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it muſt be for all ſinne. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. <hi>They are marked on their foreheads, who ſigh and cry for all the ſinnes that be done in the middeſt of the City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is good cauſe why we ſhould do ſo,<note place="margin">Peccato nihil rependitur, niſi mors. <hi>Pet. Mart. Fabius.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe the leaſt ſin is committed againſt a great God, and the ſmalleſt wages that is due to the leaſt ſinner is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Death temporall and death eternall: though all ſinnes are veniall inregard of God, yet no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:123929:32"/>ſin is veniall in regard of its littleneſſe. Laſtly, becauſe every ſinne is a publick enemy, though committed in private, as <hi>Achans</hi> ſtealing and hiding the Wedge of gold, and Babyloniſh garment, <hi>Ioſuah</hi> 7. Sin is an accurſed thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. Every ſinne is a Peace-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and Incendiary of war, yea the leaſt ſinne is a great make-bate betwixt God and Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. Evil thoughts in man, cauſed God to have evil thoughts to wards man, ſinne in thought cauſeth God to puniſh ſin indeed: as the leaſt leake in a ſhip may drowne all the paſſengers, ſo the leaſt ſinnes may deſtroy man kinde; the eating of one Apple did cauſe all the reſt in the Garden of Paradiſe to rot; the leaſt ſinne and the youngeſt ſinner do contribute toward the great ſtock of Nationall ſinnes. As the Sea conſiſteth of ſingle and ſmall drops of ſalt-water, ſo doth the ſea of miſery, of ſingle and ſmall ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it muſt be for all the miſery of an afflicted Nation. It is not enough for a man to grieve for the puniſhment of his own iniquities,<note place="margin">Proximorum damna ut pro pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe conſideration of this Aphoriſme is of uſe many wayes. If England periſh and die of her Mortal diſeaſes, blame not the Phyſitians, but the patients, we cannot ſay, there is none to plead thy cauſe, that thou mayeſt be bound up, thou haſt no healing medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.13. I durſt appeale to all antiquity, whether ever there was ſuch a Parliament Ordinance, for the cure of any ſin-ſick Nation before, ſince the dayes of <hi>Brutus.</hi> Now if this be the beſt phyſicke in the whole world, blame not the Phyſitian or the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, but thy ſelf O England, if thou dye in thy miſeries, its not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thy former ſins, but eſpecially for thy impenitency, thou wilt not repent of thy ſins: thou wilt not take this Nation-curing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſcribed to thee, by that great Colledge of Phyſitians, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1.2.</p>
                  <p>Would you know why the body-politike is leſſe at eaſe then it was before the Parliament began? certainly this is the cauſe, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament phyſick meeting with ſtrong diſtempers in an old and much decayed body, muſt needes make the kingdome deadly ſick: purging and vomiting phyſick is profitable, but troubleſome. Be willing to be ſick for thy healths ſake, quarrell not with thy Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Doctours, who are neceſſitated to do what they do, for thy health and welfare hereafter: when thy diſtempers are weaker, and fewer, thy phyſick ſhall be more gentle.</p>
                  <p>See what cauſe we have to feare Englands ruine, there are very few that do truly repent in the land, I am afraid that God may ſay of England as he did of Jeruſalem, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6. <hi>I hearkned and heard, but they ſpake not aright, no man repenteth him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, what have I done? every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi> Marke what followeth in the 10. ver. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that ſhall inherit them, for every one from the leaſt unto the greateſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to covetouſneſſe, from the Prophet even unto the Prieſt, every one dealeth falſly. verſe</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Contury of Scand.

Upon which place one ſaith, that griefe for ſinne ought to be the greateſt griefe of all: and there is very good reaſon for it, becauſe the evil of ſinne is a greater evil, then the evil of puniſhment is or can be; the one is of the Devil, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. the other is of God, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. There is ſomething good in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, there is nothing good in ſinne, onely the moſt wiſe God doth by accident turne ſin to good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. as the skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian doth make a good and healthfull uſe of poyſon to his patient.

                     <p>Reformation is ſuch a neceſſary and thorow change of things amiſſe, for the better, and that both Perſonall and Nationall, as God may be pleaſed graciouſly to accept, upon our Repentance.</p>
                     <p>In which definition conſider theſe parts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Reformation is a change of things a miſſe.</p>
                     <p>This is argued by the ſignification of the word. To re-forme, is to forme a thing again, to poliſh anew, to caſt into a new mould, to bring to the old ſtate againe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Reformation is a change of things for the better, otherwiſe it were a Deformation, a defacing of a thing.</p>
                     <p>An ancient and learned Linguiſt uſeth a word for the word Reformation, which ſignifieth to boile againe, to mend with ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to poliſh anew; all which phraſes argue a change for the better, which cannot be, except ſomething were amiſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Its a neceſſary Reformation. And this muſt needs be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perfection is neceſſary, we muſt labour for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. and Reformation is the next way, and ſhorteſt cut to it. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.23. Without a Reformation, God will make no peace, its promiſed in the 6. verſe, upon their change for the better in the 3. verſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Parliament Reformation is a thorow-Reformation. This appeareth alſo by the words in the Ordinance, where its required to be a thorow-Reformation, according to that, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.5. <hi>If yee thorowly amend your wayes and your doings,</hi> or thus, <hi>If ye make your wayes and actions altogether good.</hi>

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:123929:46"/>
                     <p>Now this thorow-Reformation it is twofold in this place. 1. It is a Church-Reformation, ver. 4.6. 2. Its a Common-weale Reformation, ver. 5. and 6. Both Church and Common-wealth were corrupted, as then, ſo now, as is ſufficiently declared by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Declarations, and therefore a thorow Reformation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. And good reaſon there is, why this ſhould be a thorow and Chriſtian correction of all matters, ſeeing a thing once well done, is twice done. The more perfect any thing is,<note place="margin">Quod bene ſit, his fit.</note> the more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and profitable it is. But more of this hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Its a Perſonall Reformation. A Chriſtian correction in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters is not onely neceſſary, but alſo a godly change in life and converſation it requiſite. Every man is to ſweep his owne doore. Every man is to amend one.<note place="margin">In directione ſua. <hi>Hieron.</hi>

                        </note> Chriſt doth not blame a man for ſeeing a mote in another mans eye, but he blameth ſuch a Chriſtian as doth not conſider the beame that is in his owne eye, and pluck it out: and therefore he commandeth him firſt to reforme himſelfe, and then he ſhall be the fitter to reforme others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.5. A man is to purifie himſelfe, as Chriſt is pure, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. Its true, we are to endeavour the ſanctification of others, but we muſt not forget our ſelves; we muſt not be like our owne eyes, that look na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and uſually more abroad, then on themſelves and face wherein they are; and therefore God hath made us a glaſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to behold our ſelves, and by which to dreſſe our ſelves, ſo as we may be beautifull and comely in his ſight, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.23. &amp;c. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man therefore be perſwaded to doe as they did in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his dayes, when the wall of Jeruſalem was repaired, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.10,<note place="margin">Aedificavit domum ſuam, <hi>Hieron.</hi>
                        </note> 28. <hi>Every Prieſt repaired over againſt his houſe, yea the daughters of Shallum did ſo too, verſe</hi> 12. Every one did keep and ſweep his owne houſe and doore. Our bleſſed Saviour rendreth a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, as a Father ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug. de Serm.

It is the property of an hypocrite to look more to others then to himſelf; and therefore as we deſire to be found ſincere and true Iſraelites, let us look in the firſt place to a Perſonall, and then to a Nationall Reformation,<note place="margin">Parl.

                     <p>The reaſons are many, and very ſtrong which have extracted this Nationall change in point of government, as you may ſee in the preamble to this Covenant betwixt the Kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, but the reaſons in the end of this Parliament Ordinance may ſuffice any moderate and welwiſhing Chriſtian, included in theſe few lines.</p>

                        </note>I will give you the anſwer of a godly Miniſter of great note in the Church of God, and its this, when a man is brought to that pitch that by the light of the ſpirit he eſteemeth all nothing but Chriſt, let him never talke, whether he be prepared or no, this is enough to bring him to converſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond conſideration is, why Reformation is called the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient-reſtoring part of Repentance.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon is, becauſe a thorow Reformation doth reſtore to the ſin-ſick patient whatſoever he loſt: as we loſe all by impenitency in ſin, ſo we gaine all by a true repentance for ſin, which is alwayes accompanied with an amendement of life, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.8. which is the ſweet fruit, that the bitter tree of repentance alwayes beareth: the leaves of this tree are like the leaves of the tree of life, which are good to heale the Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2.</p>
                     <p>Repentance is a medicine that reſtoreth health to the ſick, and healeth him of his wounds: God turneth Phyſitian to a penitent ſin-ſick ſinner, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.17.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The reaſons of the Aphoriſme.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt conſideration, why Repentance is called a potion.</p>
                     <p>Its in regard of its reſemblance to the phyſicall drink which Phyſitians give to their patients to procure their health.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. A potion is healthfull, much good cometh by it through Gods bleſſing: So is Repentance a ſalutiferous medicine, as you have heard before.</p>

                     <p>For the fiſt conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Englands ſins are infinite in number, whereof about twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kindes of ſins are reckon'd up, as you may reade in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf in the beginning of the book.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond conſideration.</p>
                     <p>They are heavy in weight and hainous in nature.</p>
                     <p>For the third conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Some of theſe twenty ſinnes are aggravated by ſeverall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as followeth.</p>
                     <p>The ſin of contempt is aggravated by 4 circumſtances. 1. Its the contempt of holy Ordinances, not of one but of all. 2. Its the contempt of Gods holy Ordinances; to contemne the Parliament Ordinances is not only a common, but a great ſin. 3. Its a high contempt. 4. Its the contempt of holines it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The ſin of ignorance is aggravated by 2 circumſtances. 1. Its
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:123929:52"/>affected. 2. Its groſſe ignorance, and this is proved by theſe words following. Under the glorious light of the Goſpel cleerly ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among us.</p>
                     <p>The ſin of unfruitfulneſſe is aggravated by one circumſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tis under the precious means of grace.</p>
                     <p>Oathes are aggravated by their multitudes.</p>
                     <p>The prophanation of the Lords day, 1. By the wickedneſſe of it. 2. By the incouragement from authority it had lately.</p>
                     <p>Diviſions are aggravated by their unnaturalneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Uncleanneſſe is ſet out with all its ſorts or kinds.</p>
                     <p>There are 2 ſins which are aggravated by many circumſtances, theſe 2 are</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Idolatry, and</item>
                        <item>2. Bloodſhed.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Idolatry is aggravated by 12 circumſtances. 1. Its old Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the ſin of our Anceſtours. 2. Its ſpreading Idolatry in theſe latter times. 3. Its connived at generally. 4. And almoſt tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. 5. Its fomented. 6. And incouraged Idolatry, and that ſeverall wayes. 7. Its a dyſaſtrous peace-breaking Idolatry, the grievous effects whereof England feeleth. 8. Its Armed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. 9. And its abetted by no ſmall ones. 10. Its Ireland-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Idolatry. 11. Its Romiſh Idolatry. 12. Its called a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, as well as bloodſhed.</p>
                     <p>Bloodſhed is aggravated likewiſe by 10 circumſtances. 1. Its a crying, 2. A cruell ſinne that calls a loud for vengeance. 3. Its not expiated, 4. But pardoned bloodſhed, unpuniſhed by man. 5. Its Maſſe or Idolatrous bloodſhed, it did go hand in hand with the Maſſe in Queene <hi>Mary</hi> her dayes. 6. It cauſed many Martyrs to dye in flames and priſons, its Martyre bloodſhed. 7. bloodſhed ſlightly confeſſed. 8. Its unpardoned bloodſhed, the wrath of the Iealous God is not appeaſed. 9. Its impious bloodſhed, its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited not onely againſt good people, but againſt God. 10. And that with a high hand, yea with ſo high a hand, or a very high hand.</p>
                     <p>For the fourth conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſins are ſo generall, as that not one man throughout the whole Nation can ſay, that he is wholly free, and that from the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is no ſoundneſſe in us, ſo that we may juſtly expect the deſolations that are denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo great and generall a corruption.</p>

                  <p>The wages of one ſinne is death, yea all kind of death; the merit of the leaſt ſinne is the greateſt puniſhment: <hi>Englands</hi> ſinnes are not onely infinite, but hainous in nature, more heavie then the ſands on the Sea-ſhoare; yea, they are aggravated with many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and are ſubjectated in the whole Kingdome, there is not one man that ſinneth not, <hi>No not one, Pſal.</hi> 14.

                     <p n="1">1. The Shop is a Mercenarie place; you muſt pay well (if not too deare) for Apothecarie ſtuffe: So muſt not it be with the Houſe of God; its the great Hall of the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, wherein he keepeth Open-houſe to all Commers, and that all the yeare long: wherein every Miniſter is like a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Steward to bid every one welcome,<note place="margin">Ad omnes qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem fideles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet, ſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis eos qui vel doctrina, vel dignitate praeſunt, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt.

                     <p n="2">2. The Apothecaries Shop its a place for all Commers though they upon a groundleſſe diſtaſte forſake their grave, learned, and pious Phyſicians and Apothecaries in their owne Cities, Townes, and Pariſhes neerer hand.

Surely, if Miniſters are eſpecially to looke to their owne flocks, over which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made then Over-ſeers, then the people are eſpecially to looke to their Paſtours for food. I doe not yet know, why the Miniſter ſhould be tyed to his flock, and not the flock to the Shepheard. Doe but conſider <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. and you ſhall finde, that as your Miniſters are to take care to feed the Church of God, ſo the Church of God is to take care how to obey their Over-ſeers.

                     <p>Fifthly, For the laſt Conſideration, what the grounds of this <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> are, I will give you theſe three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt is taken from the nature of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is not onely a fruitfull grace, but alſo bringeth forth fruit ſutable to its kind; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1 12. Now as the fruits of impenitencie are Diſcord, Civill Warre, Shame, and Adverſitie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. So the fruits of Penitencie are Peace, Glorie, and Proſperite, as appeareth likewiſe in the ſame Chapter at large.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond ground is taken from the nature of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are not onely fruitfull, but alſo correſpondent promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48, 11. We begin to feele that Peace is a good thing,<note place="margin">Carendo potius quam fruendo, Pſal. <hi>1.3.</hi>
                        </note> ſuch is the nature of man, that he priſeth a bleſſing by wanting it. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie promiſe is like that <hi>tree planted by the river ſide,</hi> which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth its <hi>fruit</hi> (according to its kind) <hi>in his ſeaſon.</hi> Now God promiſeth peace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16, 7. when our wayes pleaſe him, now we are ſure God is well pleaſed with Repentance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The laſt ground is taken from the nature of God himſelfe;<note place="margin">Ratio eptima declinandi poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, inpoeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia conſistit. Rodolp. Gualte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> who is ſo gracious, and of ſo ſweet a diſpoſition, that if a Nation turne from the <hi>evill of ſinne.</hi> God will turne from the <hi>evill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ah</hi> 3.10. If wee turne from ſinne, that is a Peace-breaker,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:123929:60"/>then God will turne to us, who is a Peace-maker. This <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> found to be true by experience; ſo did <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 20.3. The three Children and <hi>Daniel</hi> could tell you as much, <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the <hi>Jewes</hi> bate witneſſe to this Truth.</p>
                     <p>By the way, thinke not that when I ſay, Peace is a pleaſing effect, and the ſweet fruit of true Repentance, that I meane ſuch a Peace as the new <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pacification is; which I cannot but apprehend to be very dangerous to theſe three united Kingdomes, unleſſe ſome ſpeedie check be given to their proceedings and mercileſſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Believe it they who have committed the moſt outragious and barbarous Cruelties that have ever beene heard of in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, cannot ſo ſoone turne good ſubjects to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and true friends to the Proteſtant Religion, without either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or ſubmiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Let <hi>Oxford</hi> ſay what can be ſaid for their <hi>Iriſh</hi> Aſſiſtants, its an ill <hi>Omen</hi> to Religion, when the Fox is ſet to keepe the Geeſe; or to uſe the ſacred phraſe, when <hi>Cain</hi> is ſet to be <hi>Abels</hi> keeper, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.9. I doe expect the returne of <hi>Cains</hi> anſwer; <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, what it is to allure; to allure, ſignifieth to entice, to move,<note place="margin">Solicitare, qua ſolo-citare, ve ſuo loco move</note> or ſtirre up to any thing.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, conſider how many wayes it doth allure.</p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:123929:61"/>

                     <p>So this Parliament-Phyſick doth allure, by ſpeaking comfortably to the Kingdome, as you have heard; it telleth the Kingdome, that there is hope ſtill in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning the matter in hand.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, conſider what kind of Phyſick this is: The Ancients ſay, there are three kinds of Medicaments.</p>

                     <p>Phyſicall, that is Morall or Philoſophicall; ſuch Phyſick will reſtore a ſin-ſick ſinner but to a Morall perfection: and this is the Remedie that meere civill honeſt men delight to take, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

                  <p>BEcauſe diſcontented men cannot for ſhame cavill againſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Phyſick, which is Evangelicall Phyſick, and men muſt denie the whole Bible if they gaine-ſay Repentance; Therefore they fall a cavilling againſt the Phyſitians, being unwilling to take, their Phyſick, but this ſhift will not ſerve their turne in the day of death and Judgement. Their Objections are many, but to little purpoſe, I will name one or two of them, which ſeeme to have moſt reaſon and ſtrength in them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Obj.</hi> This Parliament is a Schiſmaticall Parliament, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to Reforme that Government in the Church, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parliaments did eſtabliſh.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Solemne League and Covenant, p. 5.</note> They doe but deſire to Reforme the Church accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches, as they have ſuffiently declated to the world upon their Oathes,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>. Muſc. de Schiſm.</note> and under their owne hands. Now this is a good Schiſme, whereby a Kingdome is brought into a neerer Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to the will of the great God, for hereby an evill unity and concord is broken: So Chriſt was the greateſt Schiſmatick in the world and his Diſciples, as my Author calleth them, and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is good; for ſaith he, They did cut aſunder the unitie of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: and ſuch a Schiſmaticall Church is ours and ſuch Schiſmaticall Parliaments were many of our beſt Reforming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, when they did fall off from <hi>Rome,</hi> and divided
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:123929:65"/>themſelves from the Malignant Church of Anti-chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though this Parliament hath done more then others have done in the Poynt of Reformation: yet, what have they done more then other Parliaments would have done if they might have anſwered their owne deſires, and the many Petitions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England</hi> put up to that great Aſſembly, ſtill to be ſeen? So that this preſent Parliament do but ſweat and fight out what others have wiſhed and endeavoured, though not in the ſame manner and meaſure, not meeting with the ſame neceſſities.<note place="margin">Rebus ſic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tibus.</note> And truly my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to ſpeake what I ſeriouſly thinke, a more thorow Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of abſolute neceſſitie in this Kingdome, in theſe regards and many more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe many have more knowledge then they had and they cannot ſwallow what formerly they have concocted: I wiſh with all my heart we may not be too ſcrupulous; but certainely, there is juſt cauſe why the Parliament have done as they have, in the point of Reformation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe that many did make uſe of our Ceremonies as of a Shooing-horne, to pull on Poperie withall. Say what you can for Ceremonies, they are but <hi>Romes</hi> Neſt-Egge, for the Pope to hatch his Superſtition out of. Not to be tedious, bleſſed be God for what the Parliament hath done, and the Lord finiſh his owne worke hee hath began. Let God be glorified in his owne way, in our day of Salvation; and there's an end of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, How that Parliament can be called a Schilſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Parliament,<note place="margin">Defence of Apologie.</note> which medleth but with things that belong to their Power, I am yet to learne.<note place="margin">Jewel, p. <hi>522.</hi> Si quid ex an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquis inſtitutis, legibuſve tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendum, ac rur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus condendum ſit, id de concilii ſententia fiat, Pol. Virg. l. <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>188.</hi>
                     </note> Now its well knowne to ſuch as are not wilfully ignorant, that a Parliament hath power to ſeek the health and wealth of the Church, as well as of the Common-wealth; and therefore they may detract and adde, as it ſhall moſt conduce to the welfare of both. And to ſpeake truth, otherwiſe their Power and Meeting were to little purpoſe, upon the matter: The which thing to imagine, were to undermine the Power of both Houſes of Parliament, and to tax our Anceſtours of much folly, in the Conſtitution of a fruitleſſe Remedie for Politique Maladies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Never did any Parliament goe about to reforme and cure a Kingdome, ſo contrarie to the Judgement of the Lords Spirituall and Tempotall, yea, without the conſent of many of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:123929:66"/>Commons, and without a Convocation of learned Divines, as this doth at this day.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="5">5. Co-worke with the Parliament and Synod, in ſeeking a Nationall Reformation, becauſe its a Regular and moſt perfect Reformation which they aime at.

                  </p>
                  <p>This appeareth plainely by the Solemne League and Covenant for Reformation in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> wherein, with hands lift up to the moſt High, they ſweare:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That they will ſincerely, really, and conſtantly, through the grace of God, endeavour in their ſeverall Places and Callings, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion in the Kingdomes of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What could a Nation expect more from a Parliament of Saints and Angels? They that will not beleeve them upon ſuch an Oath, are conſcious of their owne Hypocriſies and Perjuries. I know its poſſible for them to erre, and therefore let us prate leſſe, and pray more. That God would ſo guide them, that they may not miſ-leade us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Helpe forward a Nationall Reformation, becauſe without it wee can looke for no Pacification. They onely fight under the Diſplayed Banner, and Flying Colours of a Promiſe, who labour to pleaſe God by a thorow Reformation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>When a mans wayes pleaſe God, he will make even his enemies at peace with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which Promiſe collect this Doctrine, That when a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth make a thorow Reformation, God will make a happie Pacification: God will doe it, firſt, becauſe of his Wiſdome; if God ſhould doe it before, he ſhould ſtrengthen a partie againſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:123929:71"/>himſelfe: ſecondly, becauſe of his Fidelitie, who hath promiſed to make peace with man, and for man,<note place="margin">Parl. Ord. T. Covenant <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> when man maketh his peace with God, and doth breake it with ſinne, as it appeareth by the Text, and is implyed by the Ordinance, as you have heard before, as alſo by the late Covenant, in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That we and our Poſteritie after us, may as brethren live in faith and love, and the Lord may delight to dwell in the midſt of us; who is a Peace-maker, Iſa.</hi> 57.19. <hi>and is called the God of Love and Peace,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.</p>
                  <p>Now the Muſick of a Pacification is ſo ſweet, that me thinkes every one ſhould be willing to let their ſinfull engagements fall out of their hands to hearken aſter and follow ſuch tunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Wee diſlike not a Reformation, but wee would have it a Reſtauration to the Government of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of happie memorie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> For anſwer, in the firſt place, we prayſe God for that quiet and happie Government in the dayes of that pious and Reforming Princeſſe; and had ſucceeding Princes beene adviſed by as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, wiſe, and moderate Stateſ-men, as that moſt famous Lady was, Idolatrie and Superſtition could not have taken ſuch footing in this Kingdome as it hath done ſince, to the great dammage of Religion, and ſubverſion of the Fundamentall Lawes of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>But withall let my Reader know, that now the true Elevation of things indifferent is found: And I pray you, how ſarre diſtant is an Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> from the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> from a Cardinall; a Prelate from a Seminarie Prieſt; an Altar, from a Sacrifice; a Croſſe, from a Crucifix; and a goodly Cathedrall-Service, from a high Maſſe? If the caſe ſtand thus (my Maſters) judge ye, whether it can be a wiſe act of Commenſuration, to weigh Deſignes at the old Beame of State-Politiques, and conniving Conveniences? They that would now place us on old Bottomes, are ſuch in whom the old intereſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile more then the New; and if we take hold of them to guide us, I feare, they will bring us back againe into as bad a condition as we have forſaken, yea, into a worſe; for State-Relapſes are very dangerous and vindicative, becauſe there is a capacitie of Revenging recovered. This is not onely apparant by our owne Chronicles, but alſo by the examples of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> who after ſome particular violations grew more implacable and violent; not much
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:123929:72"/>unlike the Sea, when it once beginneth to make a Breach in the bounding-banks.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, ſome Po-Proteſtant-Politian may lead us about a while through ſome new and pleaſing Walkes, to take us off from a ſerious conſideration of theſe three things: firſt, whence wee came, ſecondly, where wee are; thirdly, whither wee are going: So that wee may be led through a Fooles-Paradiſe into a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For my owne part, if I may write my owne thoughts, I am perſwaded, that it both ſides ſhould lay downe their Armes, and embrace each other as <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did, yet there would be no Peace in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> though an Accommodation may be ſimilingly granted, and plauſibly entertained.
